Some trips might also be included in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's GTFS feed.
These trips are indicated with a different agency_id in the trip_agency_id field of trips.txt.
This field is not part of the GTFS specification, but was added to the feed for additional clarity.

If you are using the MBTA feed in addition to this feed, please double-check to avoid any issues.
